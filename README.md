# Glate

Build scalable future-proof web backends using your existing React skills.

## The Glate Story

Glate was borns as an alternative to NestJS (a powerful backend framework inspired by Angular). Unfortunately, NestJS has inherited all the over-engineered complexity of Angular. 

Glate aims to let you leverage your React skills and use a straightforward yet flexible and powerful functional approach to your backend development.
